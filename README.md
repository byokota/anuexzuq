# zero-anuexzuq

The goal was to find a simple i18n solution that also makes for a good Siteleaf copy writer experience.

## Polyglot rocks

* Install polyglot https://github.com/untra/polyglot
* Create a shared layout (html file) for each page
* Put the copy in md files per language (use some convention that makes sense like `<page>.<lang>.md`)
* Link pages using `{{ site.url }}` plus the relative path and let the magic begin

@takoberonty PEACE!
